# Theme System

A VS Code-style custom theming system for Ryco. Users will be able to pick from built-in themes, install community themes, and author their own — overriding any chrome color, radius, or scrollbar token.

## Goal

End-state: a user can open **Settings → Appearance**, pick a theme from a dropdown, click "Edit" to fork it as a JSON file, tweak tokens with a live preview, and import/export `.json` files. All of this works offline (web + Electron) and persists across sessions.

The architecture is purely token-driven: themes are JSON objects of CSS-variable overrides applied via a single injected `<style>` tag. Light/dark variants live inside one theme.

---

## Architecture

```
apps/web/src/
├── index.css                  Defines default :root + .dark tokens (the fallback)
├── themes/
│   ├── types.ts               ThemeDefinition + token name allow-list
│   ├── builtin.ts             Default light/dark tokens as data
│   ├── registry.ts            Storage, lookup, CSS injection
│   └── README.md              You are here.
└── hooks/
    └── useTheme.ts            Light/dark toggle + active-theme application
```

**Data flow:**

1. `useTheme` reads `ryco:theme` (light/dark/system) → toggles `.dark` class on `<html>`
2. `useTheme` reads `ryco:active-theme` → looks up theme in registry → calls `applyThemeToDocument`
3. `applyThemeToDocument` writes a `<style id="ryco-active-theme">` tag containing `:root { --x: ... } :root.dark { --y: ... }`
4. Because the style tag is appended after `index.css`, its variables win — but only ones the theme defines, so partial themes work.

**Key invariant:** `index.css` always contains the _full_ default token set. Any theme is a _patch_ on top, never a replacement. This guarantees the app never breaks if a user's theme is incomplete.

---

## Phase 1 — Foundation ✅ DONE

What shipped:

- **Tokenized remaining hard-coded colors** in `index.css`: scrollbar thumbs (regular + thin variants) and noise overlay opacity now use CSS variables (`--scrollbar-thumb*`, `--noise-opacity`).
- **Theme schema** (`types.ts`): `ThemeDefinition` with `id`, `name`, `description`, `builtIn`, `light`, `dark`. Token names are an allow-list (`THEME_TOKEN_NAMES`) for type safety + future validation.
- **Default theme as data** (`builtin.ts`): mirrors current `index.css` values — so when the active theme is `default`, no overrides are injected and the CSS file does all the work.
- **Theme registry** (`registry.ts`): `getAllThemes()`, `findTheme()`, `getActiveThemeId()`, `setActiveThemeId()`, `getCustomThemes()`, `setCustomThemes()`, `applyThemeToDocument()`. Storage keys `ryco:active-theme` and `ryco:custom-themes`.
- **`useTheme` integration**: applies the active theme alongside the existing light/dark toggle. New API surface: `activeThemeId`, `setActiveTheme(id)`. Cross-tab sync works via the `storage` event listener.
- **Defensive guards**: `applyThemeToDocument` no-ops when DOM isn't available (Node test envs).

Verified: zero new test failures vs main (same 8 pre-existing env-dependent failures both before and after).

---

## Phase 2 — Theme Picker UI ✅ DONE

What shipped:

- **New `Settings → Appearance` route** at `apps/web/src/routes/settings.appearance.tsx`, sibling to `settings.general.tsx`.
- **Sidebar entry** in `SettingsSidebarNav` (`PaletteIcon`, between General and Source Control).
- **`AppearanceSettingsPanel`** component (`apps/web/src/components/settings/AppearanceSettings.tsx`):
  - Theme palette dropdown — populated from `getAllThemes()`, calls `setActiveTheme(id)`.
  - Color mode selector — light/dark/system (moved from General to consolidate appearance settings).
  - Active theme description + "Built-in" badge surfaced as the row's status text.
  - Reset-to-default chips on both rows when not at defaults.
- **Three new built-in themes** appended to `BUILT_IN_THEMES`: `solarized-dark` (both variants), `nord` (dark variant; light falls back to default), `high-contrast` (both variants, monochrome with yellow accents).
- **Settings shell** (`routes/settings.tsx`) now shows "Restore defaults" on `/settings/appearance` in addition to `/settings/general`.
- **Unit tests** (`themes/registry.test.ts`): `findTheme` fallback, `resolveTokens` merging (overlay over base, partial themes), `tokensToCss` output shape.

Verified: 1011/1011 unit tests pass; typecheck shows only the pre-existing `SortableContext` error; in-browser eval confirms each new theme's tokens land on `:root` and the active id persists across reload.

---

## Phase 3 — Custom Theme Editor ✅ DONE

What shipped:

- **Registry helpers** (`registry.ts`):
  - `duplicateTheme(source)` — generates a `custom-<id>` (with collision avoidance) and `"<name> (Copy)"`, force-sets `builtIn: false`
  - `addCustomTheme`, `updateCustomTheme`, `deleteCustomTheme` — persist via `setCustomThemes`; `delete` falls back to `default` when the deleted theme was active; `update` rotates the active id when the theme is renamed; rename collisions throw
  - `isBuiltInThemeId(id)` for guarding edits/deletes
  - `isValidColorValue(value)` — rejects empty / >200 char / `javascript:` / `expression(` / `<script` / `url(javascript:)`
  - `isValidTheme` is now exported (used by the JSON editor)
- **Inline `<ThemeEditor>` panel** (`apps/web/src/components/settings/ThemeEditor.tsx`) rendered inside the Theme palette row. Includes:
  - Name + Description inputs
  - **Form mode**: tokens grouped by category (Surfaces, Brand & focus, Neutrals, Status, Borders & inputs, Scrollbars, Misc) with a swatch preview, raw value input (CSS expressions like `oklch(...)` / `var(...)` / `color-mix(...)` allowed), `×` to reset, `--token` label monospaced
  - **JSON mode**: schema-validated textarea using `isValidTheme`; Save disabled while invalid
  - **Variant tabs**: edit `light` / `dark` independently
  - **Live preview**: `applyThemeToDocument(draft)` runs on every draft/variant change; on cancel/unmount the source theme is re-applied so abandoned changes don't leak
  - Save/Cancel buttons; cancel prompts via `window.confirm` if the draft is dirty
  - Delete button (custom themes only) with a confirmation prompt
- **Appearance settings wiring** (`AppearanceSettings.tsx`):
  - "Duplicate" button forks the active theme and immediately enters edit mode on the copy
  - "Edit" button on a built-in fork-and-edits; on a custom theme edits in place
  - Active palette badge shows "Built-in" or "Custom"
- **Tests** added:
  - `themes/registry.test.ts` — 16 new tests for `isBuiltInThemeId`, `isValidColorValue`, `isValidTheme`, custom-theme storage (add/update/delete/active rotation/rename collision), `duplicateTheme`, `generateCustomThemeId`
  - `components/settings/ThemeEditor.test.ts` — pure helpers `setTokenValue`, `setThemeName`, `setThemeDescription` (variant isolation, empty-value removal, immutability)

Verified: 1033/1033 unit tests pass; `tsc --noEmit` clean (only the pre-existing `Sidebar.tsx` `SortableContext` error). In-browser eval against the live Vite bundle confirmed the full acceptance path: forked default → set `light.primary` to `red` → saved → `getComputedStyle(:root).--primary === "red"` → full page reload still shows `red` and `localStorage["ryco:active-theme"] === "custom-default"`. Collision avoidance, value validation, and active-theme fallback after delete were all confirmed live.

---

## Phase 4 — Import / Export & Sharing ✅ DONE

What shipped:

- **`themes/transport.ts`** — single module that owns all serialization:
  - `serializeTheme(theme)` — strips `builtIn`, emits stable JSON (id, name, description?, light?, dark?)
  - `parseTheme(raw)` — reuses `isValidTheme`, returns a fresh `ThemeDefinition` with `builtIn: false`
  - `themeFilename(theme)` — slugifies name into `<slug>.t3theme.json`
  - `downloadTheme(theme)` — uses a `Blob` + `<a download>` to push the file to disk
  - `importTheme(raw, collision)` — `"rename"` (default; always safe) or `"replace"`. Built-in id collisions are always renamed since you can't replace a built-in. Returns `{ theme, action }` where action is `added | renamed | replaced`.
  - `importThemeFromFile(file, { collision, activate })` — async helper; can immediately switch the active theme to the imported one
  - `encodeThemeToBase64` / `decodeThemeFromBase64` — UTF-8-safe round-trip; works in both browser (`btoa`/`atob` + `TextEncoder`) and Node (`Buffer`)
  - `copyThemeToClipboard(theme)` — `navigator.clipboard.writeText(serializeTheme(theme))`
- **Appearance row "Share & sync"** in `AppearanceSettings.tsx`:
  - **Export** — downloads `<name>.t3theme.json`
  - **Import** — hidden `<input type="file">` triggered from the button; on success the imported theme becomes active and a toast announces add/rename
  - **Copy JSON** — clipboard copy with a success toast
  - All errors surface through `toastManager.add({ type: "error", ... })`
- **Schema documentation** added below — authors can hand-write `.t3theme.json` files
- **Tests** (`themes/transport.test.ts`): 18 new tests covering filename slugging, serialize/parse round-trips, parse error paths, base64 round-trips (including UTF-8 names), `importTheme` for added/renamed/replaced (including built-in id collision), and `getCustomThemes` reflecting writes after import

Verified: `bun --cwd apps/web run test` → 1051/1051 pass; `bun --cwd apps/web run typecheck` clean (only pre-existing Sidebar.tsx error). Live browser eval confirmed the round-trip end-to-end: export the active theme to a string → wipe localStorage → import the string → activate → reload → identical computed `--primary` value.

---

## Theme JSON schema

Files use the `.t3theme.json` extension and follow this shape:

```json
{
  "id": "my-theme",
  "name": "My Theme",
  "description": "Optional one-liner",
  "light": {
    "primary": "#ff0000",
    "background": "#fafafa"
  },
  "dark": {
    "primary": "oklch(0.6 0.2 264)"
  }
}
```

Rules:

- `id` and `name` must be non-empty strings.
- `light` and `dark` are both optional. Tokens missing from a variant fall back to the default theme's values for that variant.
- Token values must be strings. Allowed: any CSS color, `var(...)`, `oklch(...)`, `color-mix(...)`, percentages, `rgba(...)`, etc.
- The full token allow-list lives in `types.ts` (`THEME_TOKEN_NAMES`). Tokens outside that set are ignored on save by the editor; on import they're preserved but won't be emitted to CSS.
- `builtIn` is ignored on import — every imported theme becomes a custom theme.

---

## Phase 5 — Syntax Highlighting Integration (Optional)

**Goal:** Themes also restyle code blocks.

Current state: code highlighting is shiki-based (see `chat-markdown-shiki` rule and `ChatMarkdown.tsx`). Today shiki uses its own theme list independent of chrome.

Tasks:

- [ ] Extend `ThemeDefinition` with an optional `syntax` field — either a shiki theme name (e.g. `"github-dark"`) or an inline TextMate-style theme JSON
- [ ] Plumb the active theme's `syntax` value into the shiki highlighter call site
- [ ] Provide a sensible default per theme variant (light → `github-light`, dark → `github-dark`)
- [ ] Ship one full theme (chrome + syntax) end-to-end as a reference

Acceptance: switching theme also re-colors code blocks; falls back gracefully if the syntax theme is missing.

---

## Phase 6 — Polish

- [ ] Add a "Reset to default" button per setting in the editor
- [ ] Validate color values at save time (reject `--primary: javascript:alert(1)` etc.) — token values must match a CSS-color/length grammar
- [ ] Animate transitions on theme switch (already partially handled by `.no-transitions` class)
- [ ] Sync custom themes to disk in Electron via `desktopBridge` so they survive uninstall/clearStorage (separate file, e.g. `userdata/themes/`)
- [ ] Telemetry: count theme installs/exports if useful
- [ ] Marketplace stub: a curated list rendered in the picker, fetched from a GitHub-hosted JSON index

## File reference (current Phase 1 state)

| File                              | Purpose                                                                                      |
| --------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `apps/web/src/index.css`          | Default tokens for `:root` and `.dark` (the fallback every theme patches)                    |
| `apps/web/src/themes/types.ts`    | `ThemeDefinition`, `ThemeTokens`, `THEME_TOKEN_NAMES`                                        |
| `apps/web/src/themes/builtin.ts`  | `DEFAULT_THEME` + `BUILT_IN_THEMES`                                                          |
| `apps/web/src/themes/registry.ts` | Storage, lookup, CSS injection (`applyThemeToDocument`)                                      |
| `apps/web/src/hooks/useTheme.ts`  | React hook — exposes `theme`, `setTheme`, `resolvedTheme`, `activeThemeId`, `setActiveTheme` |

## Storage keys

| Key                  | Type                            | Purpose                              |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `ryco:theme`         | `"light" \| "dark" \| "system"` | Light/dark/system mode (existing)    |
| `ryco:active-theme`  | string (theme id)               | Which theme to apply (new — Phase 1) |
| `ryco:custom-themes` | `ThemeDefinition[]` JSON        | User-authored themes (new — Phase 1) |

## Hook API

```ts
const { theme, setTheme, resolvedTheme, activeThemeId, setActiveTheme } = useTheme();

// theme:          "light" | "dark" | "system"  (the variant)
// resolvedTheme:  "light" | "dark"             (system resolved)
// activeThemeId:  string                       (which palette is active)
// setTheme(v):    change variant
// setActiveTheme(id): change palette
```

## Token allow-list

Defined in `types.ts`. Adding a new token requires:

1. Append to `THEME_TOKEN_NAMES`
2. Add the variable to `:root` (and `.dark` if needed) in `index.css`
3. Add to `DEFAULT_THEME.light` / `.dark` in `builtin.ts` so existing themes don't break

This enforces a single source of truth for what's themable.
